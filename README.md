WORKOUT TRACKER APPLICATION IN  PYTHON USING GOOGLE SHEETS

The Workout Tracker Application in Python using Google Sheets is a tool designed to help individuals track and manage their workout routines and progress using the Python programming language and Google Sheets as a backend storage system. This application allows users to input their workout details, such as exercise types, sets, reps, weights, and dates, which are then stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for easy access and analysis.

Here's a detailed description of the components and functionality of the Workout Tracker Application:
1. User Interface (CLI)
The application typically operates through a Command-Line Interface (CLI), where users interact with the program by entering commands and providing input.
2. Google Sheets Integration
The core feature of the application is its integration with Google Sheets, a cloud-based spreadsheet application. The application utilizes the Google Sheets API to read from and write to a designated spreadsheet where workout data is stored.
3. Authentication and Authorization
To interact with the Google Sheets API, users must authenticate their application with Google. This usually involves creating credentials, such as OAuth tokens or service account keys, to authorize the application to access the user's Google Sheets.
4. Configuration
Users need to configure the application with necessary parameters such as Google Sheets API credentials file, spreadsheet ID, and sheet name. These configurations allow the application to connect to the correct Google Sheets document for storing workout data.
5. Data Input
Users input their workout data through the CLI interface. This typically includes details such as exercise names, sets, reps, weights, and dates. The application validates the input data before sending it to the Google Sheets API for storage.
6. Data Storage
The application stores the input workout data in the designated Google Sheets spreadsheet. Each workout entry is typically recorded in a row of the spreadsheet, with columns representing different attributes such as exercise type, sets, reps, weights, and dates.
7. Data Retrieval
Users can retrieve and view their workout data from the Google Sheets spreadsheet using the application. This feature allows users to track their progress over time, analyze trends, and make informed decisions about their workout routines.
